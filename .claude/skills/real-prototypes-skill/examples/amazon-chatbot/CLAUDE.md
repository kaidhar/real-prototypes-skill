# Amazon India Shopping Chatbot - Example

This example demonstrates the Platform Prototype Skill by creating a fully functional shopping chatbot for Amazon India.

## Project Configuration

```
PLATFORM_URL=https://www.amazon.in/
PLATFORM_EMAIL=
PLATFORM_PASSWORD=
```

## Capture Settings

```
PAGES_TO_CAPTURE=/homepage
CAPTURE_MODE=manual
VIEWPORT_WIDTH=1920
VIEWPORT_HEIGHT=1080
WAIT_AFTER_LOAD=2000
```

## Feature Request

The original request was:

> "I want to add a new chatbot window in Amazon where users can find any product and place order from there itself."

## What Was Generated

The skill generated a complete Next.js prototype with:

### Components
- **ChatbotWindow.tsx** - Main chatbot with AI-like conversation
- **ChatbotButton.tsx** - Floating action button
- **ProductCard.tsx** - Product display with images and pricing

### Features
- 🔍 **Smart Product Search** - 11 products across 4 categories (headphones, laptops, phones, watches)
- 🛒 **Shopping Cart** - Add items, manage quantities, real-time counter
- 📦 **Order Tracking** - Place orders and track status
- 💰 **Price Filtering** - Search "laptop under 50000" works
- ⚡ **Buy Now** - Quick checkout flow
- 🎯 **Action Buttons** - Contextual quick actions

### Design Accuracy
- Exact Amazon colors captured (#FF9900, #131921, #FFD814)
- Typography matched (Amazon Ember font family)
- Spacing and layout from design tokens
- Mobile responsive design

- MacBook Pro M3
- iPhone 15 Pro
- Samsung Galaxy S24
- Apple Watch Series 9

### Smart Search Algorithm
- Category detection (headphone → headphones)
- Brand matching (Sony, Apple, Dell, etc.)
- Price filtering with natural language
- Relevance ranking

### State Management
- Cart stored in React state
- Order history tracking
- Real-time navbar counter updates

## Try These Prompts

In the chatbot, try:
- "Show me headphones"
- "I want a laptop under 50000"
- "Show me iphone"
- "Add to cart" (after seeing products)
- "Show my cart"
- "Track my orders" (after placing order)

## Generated with Platform Prototype Skill

This entire prototype was generated by describing the feature to Claude Code with the Platform Prototype Skill installed. The skill:
1. Captured Amazon India's design
2. Extracted colors and typography
3. Generated matching React components
4. Implemented full functionality

Total development time: ~10 minutes
